# Graphical Encoding - Exercise

Original Observable notebook can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/d/1e9302e360db6008@1198).

In this exercise, we have a dataset that contains the unemployment rate for each state for December 2019. Your task is to visualize this data in 5 different ways. This exercise is about exploring possibilities, so it's okay if some of your visualizations aren't the most effective.
